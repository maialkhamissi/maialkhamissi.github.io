I am currently a PhD candidate in the department of Anthropology at Princeton University. My dissertation is supervised by Dr. Julia Elyachar and Dr. Sergeui Oushakin. Previously I completely a MA in Anthropology and Cultural Politics at Goldsmiths, the University of London where I was supervised by Dr. Massimiliano Mollona. 

My current research is on themes relating to diaspora, exile, migration, revolt, and social change. 

My dissertation project examines waves of Egyptians who left Egypt due to political reasons over three generations. I examine the conceptual difference between exiles and immigrants, propose a feminist understanding of the experiences of mobility and displacement and examine the intellectual history of Arabic terms relating to the experience such.as ghorba and manfa. 

My research has been supported by the department of anthropology, the department of Near Eastern Studies and the Princeton Institute for International and Regional studies.

I presented my research in the American Anthropological Association conference, the Middle East Studies Association conference and the American Ethnological society.  

In addition to my PhD dissertation, I also work detecting biases and parsing out cultural trends in large language models such as ChatGPT in collaboration with computer scientists. 
 
Over the past year, I collaborated on a project with Dr. Mona Diab, Mohamed ElNokrashy and Badr AlKhamissi which was accepted to the ACL 2024 and IC2S2 2024 conferences. I am currently doing a Higher Education Fellowship at the Language and Technology Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of Dr. Mona Diab. 
 
I also have been actively working with the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning and Princeton University. I am trained as a coach to both undergraduate and graduate students where I mentor students 1:1 and run support groups for dissertation writing. 

I taught at the American university in Cairo Introduction to Sociology. I TAed at Princeton anthropology of revolutions, sensory anthropology and taught my own sections for introduction of anthropology. I also held a community college teaching fellowship where I shadow taught at Camden County College.


Before Princeton, I worked in Egypt as a researcher at a think tank, at the Access to Knowledge and Development Center at the Business school at the American University in Cairo and I was part of a research team tasked to redesign Kasr el-Ainy, the biggest public hospital in Egypt. 


I was a researcher at the Institute of Gender and Women studies. I worked on a project called the Imagination of the political under the supervision of Dr. Hanan Sabea and Dr. Martina Reiker. The project was funded by the IDRC and we spent three years tracking political changes in Egypt after the relocation, doing fieldwork and conducting media reviews on the areas of trade union action, artists and art spaces and religious spaces. 

I am currently interested in transitioning to the field of computational social science. My collaborative work was very fruitful and through my fellowship at LTI, I’m excited for more conversations and shared research methods between social and computer scientists. Please reach out if you have ideas for projects and/or if you’re interested in collaboration.
